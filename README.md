# ImageHideProject
App in Python (3.x) for hiding text inside images.

## Getting Started
It uses _NumPy_ and _scikit-image_ in order to modify LSB of each pixel hiding a text previously coded in UTF-16.
It also uses _Crypto_ to encrypt and decrypt the message (SHA-256).

Graphic Interface created using _Tkinter_

### Prerequisites
Project created on Windows.

_NumPy_, _scikit-image_, _Crypto_ and _Tkinter_ libraries are necessary (_Tkinter_ library comes in default with every Python installation).
Installation using "pip":
```
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-image
pip install pycrypto
```
Installation in anaconda environment:
```
conda install numpy
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image
conda install -c anaconda pycrypto
```
